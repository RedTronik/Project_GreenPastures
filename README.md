# Project_GreenPastures

This is a project i am working on for my degree. This code runs on a STM nucleo 411RE and is controlled over serial.
The STM controlls a test platform with four home made meccanum-like wheels. Comments in the code are in Slovenian. 

It's also my very first project uploaded to github.
